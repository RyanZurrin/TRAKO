Position (True/False) treats points as X,Y,Z coordinates.

Sequential (True/False) keeps track of the order of points. Should be always on for Trako.

Quantization bits should be an integer between 0 and 31

Compression level should be an integer between 0 and 10

Quantization_range is a float representing the size of the bounding cube for the mesh.
By default it is the range of the dimension of the input vertices with greatest range.

Quantization_origin is the point in space where the bounding box begins. By default it is
a point where each coordinate is the minimum of that coordinate among the input vertices.
